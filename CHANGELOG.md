## [2.1] — 2026-04-19

### Changed
- Renamed plugin directory and entry point: `btrfs-snapper` → `snap-man` (avoids collision with system `snap` command — DEC-016)
- Renamed unified entry point: `snap()` → `snap-man()` (DEC-016)

### Added
- `snap-help` — display all available commands with descriptions
- `man-s` alias — quick access to `snap-help`
- Short aliases for all commands (DEC-016):
  - `snap-m` → `snap-man` (unified manager)
  - `snap-l` → `snap-list`
  - `snap-n` → `snap-new`
  - `snap-r` → `snap-rollback`
  - `snap-d` → `snap-del`
  - `snap-c` → `snap-compare`
- DEC-017 compliant banner (CYAN border, version + date, SafeITExperts)

## [2.0] — 2026-04-12

### Changed
- Translated all comments and output messages to English
- Replaced `snap-list`, `snap-new`, `snap-rollback` full function bodies with lightweight stubs
  — these features are now provided by independent plugins (`zsh-snap-list`, `zsh-snap-new`, `zsh-snap-rollback`)
  — stubs display a clear install message if the plugin is not loaded

### Added
- `snap()` — unified entry point with interactive menu: list / create / rollback
  — delegates to the three independent plugins
  — colored display with ANSI box border

### Removed
- Embedded `snap-list` implementation (moved to `zsh-snap-list` plugin)
- Embedded `snap-new` implementation (moved to `zsh-snap-new` plugin)
- Embedded `snap-rollback` implementation (moved to `zsh-snap-rollback` plugin)
